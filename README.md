 input proper line in browser.
 Example of line to input in browser:

 And it should show:  
 "String contains 4 Lowercase letters contains 4 Uppercase letters contains 3 numbers contains 3 special signs"
 If you input "%", "?" or "#" api will not count them as special signs but will most probably not work properly.
